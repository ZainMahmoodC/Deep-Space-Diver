# Deep Space Diver

Deep Space Diver is a platformer game with puzzles. You can jump between planets through overlapping gravity fields. Collect gears to fix the broken teleporter and move on to the next level! Avoid colliding with enemys, that they will take all of the gears you have collected and you would have to restart. Find a way out and spend a nice vacation at the alien planet.
