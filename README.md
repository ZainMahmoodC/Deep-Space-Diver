# Deep Space Diver

Deep Space Diver is a platformer game were you jump between planets through overlapping gravity fields. Collect gears to fix the broken teleporter and move on to the next level! Avoid colliding with enemies: you will lose all of the gears you have collected and need to restart the level. Find a way out and spend a nice vacation on an alien planet!

## Getting involved

Do you want to be a part of this project? Well, here's how you can start!

### Prerequisites

Deep Space Diver is written in Javascript. You can use any Javascript editor that you like. But you have to spin up a local server to test play the game.

We used [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download) for our project, since it has a built-in server. If you are student, you can download the full version of WebStorm for free with your student account.
